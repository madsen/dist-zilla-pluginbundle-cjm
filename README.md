Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-CJM
==================================

Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::CJM (formerly Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::CJM) is the basic configuration I use when
building CPAN modules with Dist::Zilla.  This distribution used to
include a collection of plugins I've written, but those are now
distributed separately (in
[Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM](http://github.com/madsen/dist-zilla-plugins-cjm)),
so that you don't have to install every single plugin I use and all
their prerequisites.

If you previously installed this bundle to get one of the plugins, you
should uninstall this bundle, and install Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM instead.
Sorry for any confusion this causes.

This is a Git repository where development of Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-CJM
takes place.  For more information, visit
[Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-CJM on MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-CJM).

This repository now contains only Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::CJM.  The
original repository that used to be located here is now called
[dist-zilla-plugins-cjm](http://github.com/madsen/dist-zilla-plugins-cjm).
