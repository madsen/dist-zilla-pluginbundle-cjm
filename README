Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-CJM version {{$version}}, released {{$date}}


Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::CJM is the basic configuration I use when
building CPAN modules with Dist::Zilla.  This distribution used to
include a collection of plugins I've written, but those are now
distributed separately (in Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM), so that you don't
have to install every single plugin I use and all their prerequisites.

If you previously installed this bundle to get one of the plugins, you
should uninstall this bundle, and install Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM instead.
Sorry for any confusion this causes.
